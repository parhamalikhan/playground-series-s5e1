        "Approach:\n",
        "\n",
        "Data Collection: The first step is to load and examine the provided datasets (train.csv, test.csv, and sample_submission.csv) which contain historical sales data, product details, and sample submission format.\n",
        "\n",
        "Data Cleaning: Clean the data by handling missing values, removing irrelevant data, and ensuring that the dataset is ready for analysis and model building.\n",
        "\n",
        "Feature Engineering: Next, we'll create new features from the existing ones to make the dataset more informative for the machine learning model. This might include features like day of the week, holidays, or seasonality effects that might influence sales.\n",
        "\n",
        "Model Building: Using machine learning algorithms (e.g., linear regression, decision trees, or ensemble models), we will build models to predict the num_sold (number of items sold).\n",
        "\n",
        "Model Evaluation: The model's performance will be evaluated using the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), a common metric for regression tasks, to understand how accurate the model's predictions are.\n",
        "\n",
        "Prediction: Finally, the model will be used to generate predictions for the test data, which will then be formatted and submitted as per the required submission structure.\n",
        "\n",
        "Goal of this Notebook: This notebook will guide through the steps of loading the data, cleaning it, engineering features, training models, and making predictions. At the end of the process, we aim to have a model that performs well on the Kaggle competition and helps forecast sticker sales effectively.\n",
